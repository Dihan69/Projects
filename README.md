From Semester 1 of our IUT life, I have made games for final project. The first of which was making GAME OF LIFE as a assignment of structured programming I course. 
Next in Semester 2, as a team project, we made a game using C language using only ASCII characters and no external library. The game 10+ minigames and a story that matches with that. 
The third game in Semester 3 was also made with ASCII characters as part of C++ course which was a platformer game with 3 levels.
In 4th semester, we also made a platformer game using JAVA but this time we used images and sprite to upgrade to a colorful version. The game had 10 levels with player having different abilities.
Finally, in 5th semester, we made top down RPG game with JAVA that had a story of 3 hours long. (It would require little more work to make the game fully functional)
