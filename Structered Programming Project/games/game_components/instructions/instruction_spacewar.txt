          You have to dodge or destroy the spacecrafts coming towards you. Sometimes it   
          becomes hard to dodge them.                                                     
                                                                                          
          To destroy a spacecraft, you need to destroy its core marked with C. But to     
          reach the core, you need to destroy the outer guns first.                       
                                                                                          
          In most cases, inner guns can't be destroyed without destroying outer guns.     
          There are 2 shooting modes, with 'F' and 'Space'. 'Space' will shoot 2 bullets  
          at a time and 'F' will shoot 1. There is a charge which denotes the shooting    
          power.                                                                          
                                                                                          
          If it gets fully emptied, you won't be able to shoot for a while until it fully 
          recharges. You can go up, down, right, left with arrow keys.
