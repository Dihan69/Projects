You have to defeat the snake by killing it. You have 5 lives to do so.                
                                                                                      
The snake will chase you continuously. But after a certain time it will stop to regain
its strength. You can do better damage at that time. But at that time, brick pieces   
might fall on you. There is a very little delay before the brick piece falls upon you.
So, be careful.                                                                       
                                                                                      
To kill the snake, you have a gun which shoots six bullets at a time. If all the      
bullets are used, you have to reload it.                                              
                                                                                      
Use arrow keys to move in four direction. Use WASD keys to shoot in four direction.   
Use R key to reload the bullets.
