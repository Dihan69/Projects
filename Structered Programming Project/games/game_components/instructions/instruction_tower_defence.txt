          Try to protect the data from external breach. Use the pulse regulators to       
          eliminate breach.                                                               
                                                                                          
          The up, down, left and right pulse regulators can be opererated by W, S, A, D   
          keys respectively.                                                              
                                                                                          
          Don't let too much data to get affected by the breach. Otherwise, the system    
          will crash and all data will be lost.
