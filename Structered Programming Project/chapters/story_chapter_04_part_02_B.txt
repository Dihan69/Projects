     Yeah, an unknown protocol. Designed to affect or infiltrate or, even worse,      
     control the STEM server system.

     What? How can it be inside the system without anyone noticing?

     This was done by someone from inside us. While cracking the protocol, I found a  
     digital signature within it. And it was FOX's.

     What? But he is one of our security experts. Why would he-

     Hmmm and that's the easiest way to get access to the system and also monitor it.

     I cannot believe. But why would he do so? FOX, don't you have anything to say?

     That's right. Why don't you speak?

Considering the suspense inside the conference room, FOX's silence felt odd to me. For
a brief moment, FOX looked towards me and then suddenly his eyes started to glow red. 
Everyone was so suspenesed within the moment that they didn't even notice.

     (realizing) Everyone down and away from FOX.                                     
                                                                                      
Within a moment, FOX's head blew up. He was under control of the IIRUS net the whole  
time. The incident alerted the organiztion security even more.
