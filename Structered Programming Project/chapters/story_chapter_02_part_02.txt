     I guess that was the last door. Everyone, report your positions?

     We are here.

     Looks like all the doors lead here. And this place... looks like a hall room.

     Look! There's a door at the end of the room. Maybe it is the exit.

     Might be. Everyone, let's get out of here.

     Why the place is shaking so much?

     (realizing) The mansion! It's about to breakdown.

A large boulder falls right behind NHAQ.

     Everyone, watch out the bricks. The hall way is pretty much long. We have to 
     run to the exit. Let's go.
