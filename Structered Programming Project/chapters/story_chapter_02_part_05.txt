(everyone panting heavily)

     The area is erased. But we are out of the bounds now.

     I think we got enough locations for now.                                   
                                                                                
     SPECTRE                                                                    
     Let's head back to headquarters before anything else happens.              
                                                                                
     MRIDHA                                                                     
     Yeah.                                                                      
                                                                                
We move back to headquarters taking the shortest route possible.The headquarter 
is protected by high security protocol, always being monitored and maintained by
security experts.                                                               
                                                                                
After submitting the reports to the headquarters, we are dismissed for the day. 
                                                                                
Until the next time.
