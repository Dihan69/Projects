     We don't have enough time though.

     Hmmm. We are already being attacked randomly. The more we delay, the more  
     severe the threat becomes. The IIRUS control radar may not locate us, for  
     now, due to the security protocols but it might not be the same afterwards.

     The events also increases the threat revealing the loop holes.

     Yeah. So, shall we continue?

     Hmmm. Look at the location we were before.

     (looks on the map) The district 06, it's blank now.

     Hmmm. That means the network access is denied from there but only for us.

     So, for now, we can only access an area for once and it will block the     
     access to the network when we leave from there?

     Hmmm. When we leave from there "safely".

     You are right. We have to be careful.

     Hmmm. Let's get going.
