The support team reached the location within an hour. We reported back to the   
headquarters safely.                                                            
                                                                                
We were kept under observation for health reasons for about a month.            
                                                                                
The divisions were disconnected from the IIRUS net. Also, the networks making   
the divisions centre of it all were disrupted. The survivors from the divisions 
were taken under maintanence providing support and medic from the headquarters. 
                                                                                
Due to the major node break, there is no response from the IIRUS net for about  
a week. The research team is speculating the network might have been destroyed  
due to the over-ride launch. Still they are trying to find trace of the network.
                                                                                
I hope it ends here.
