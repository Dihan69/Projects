You have break all the gate-links on the map. But beware of the glitroids that are  
spawn from the gate-links. Glitroids can spawn anywhere in a certain radius from a  
particular gate-link. You can kill the glitroids by shooting then but it will       
require you shooting them continuously for a certain amount of time.                
                                                                                    
There is an health bar on the upper-right corner of the screen. Your health will    
decrease if you are very close to a glitroid.                                       
                                                                                    
By going near the gate-links and pressing SPACE, you can initiate gate-link break.  
You have to press SPACE key for a certain amount of time until a pop-up status bar  
becomes full to completely break gate-links. Once a gate-link is broken it will     
disappear from the map along with enemies around a certain radius of the gate-link.
