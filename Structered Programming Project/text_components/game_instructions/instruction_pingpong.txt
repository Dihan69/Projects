          Try to contain the ball inside the boundary using the slidebars. Don't let it   
          hit the boundary, otherwise, it will cause the system to breakdown.             
                                                                                          
          The upper and lower bar are connected and you can move them using left or right 
          key in the same direction.                                                      
                                                                                          
          Again, the right and left bar are also connected and they can be moved by       
          up or down key altogether.                                                      
                                                                                          
          From this point, you can access the in-game menu by pressing ESCAPE button while
          inside any game. There you can view the game instructions again.
