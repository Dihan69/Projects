          Escape towards the end of the roads.                                            
                                                                                          
          You can't stop. But you can go up, down, left & right using arrow keys.         
                                                                                          
          Getting hit from the sides or behind is not problem but don't get hit upfront.  
                                                                                          
          A suggestion - You need to go downwards to cross sharp corner without getting   
          hit.
