It has been 6 hours of the search. We have covered many areas until now. In every   
area, the network links are spread like a spider web. We have to find a way to break
the links as fast as possible. But that is something to think about afterwards. Now,
we need to focus on getting back to headquarters from here.

     We have managed to trace this far. This is the last area on the map.

     Yeah. But the phase reading of this area is suspiciously low. It doesn't       
     match with the reports we got so far.

     The glitch is unstable for some reason here. See the houses are glitching      
     randomly.

     We should get moving now.                                                      
                                                                                    
As we start to approach the city, the glitching intensifies. Still we continue      
to move on. There were no network link basically. But suddenly the environment      
starts to warp.

     (alerted) What is it this time?

     Look out! That house just went blank!

     Somehow the link must've have been broken before we entered the area. Let's get
     out of here fast.

     Otherwise we will be erased.

     Hmmm. No doubt. Let's go.
