     Backup complete. Drive removed.

     The breach almost destroyed the data. Some data were lost in the process but we
     can handle the damage.

     Hmmm. But isn't it unusual?

     Hmmm. Sure, an unusual incident. We'll look into the matter. Inform the        
     security experts to reroll the mainframe.

     Okay. I'll notify them.                                                        
                                                                                    
Generally no one can access the residence server from outside. It is not connected  
with any other external network as well. Until someone does it from inside.         
                                                                                    
Maybe I need to look into the matter.
