We somehow managed to get out of the zone of the over-ride. The vehicle is pretty   
much damaged. It would not last long. We need to contact with the headquarters.     
                                                                                    
After going a few miles more, the vehicle crashed. It was a good coincidence that we
were very close to an abandoned airport. The air route would be the safest way back.
                                                                                    
There were not many planes there. An old fighter plane's engine looked pretty much  
in a good state. We took off right at the moment.                                   
                                                                                    
But suddenly the environment started to warp. The over-ride caused a huge distortion
int the environment.                                                                
                                                                                    
Looks like there's going to be another level!
