The over-ride pretty much destroyed everything in it's way. But it also caused a
huge distortion in the reality.                                                 
                                                                                
The reality around us started to warp really fast. In a moment, there was a wave
of fighter planes in front of us.

     What is that? A war fleet?

     Don't know but, at least, I know we are going to be under attack.

     Hmmm. What is the state of the guns of this plane?

     Somewhat good.

     All we have to do is dodge them as much as we can.

     I don't think that will be enough for everyone of them!

     Hmmm. Everyone get to positions. We have to make it. There's no way going  
     back now.
