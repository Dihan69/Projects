     Okay then. NHAQ, Trace the first location.

     It's 1.5 miles away from current location. There were a couple of deaths reported
     from that area. But the place seems to be deserted.

     Most of the people of this division were evacuated during the 5th phase of IIRUS.
     But there were some residentials left back in the area as the Government could   
     not support to quarantine the division fully at the time.

     Hmmm. Let's get going then.

     It seems that this part of the division is actually abandoned.

     Yeah. This area is just full of bushes and vines. I don't know if it will be     
     worth the search.

     I know. But still let's cover the area as quickly as possible. We have to find   
     out all the nework links in this area.
