(a week later)                                                                  
                                                                                
We are reported to prepare for the CRACK operation. To maintain the security of 
the current progress, no new team member will be added to the team. So, we have 
to do it by ourselves. We, three of us, are appointed to three different        
divisions for the operation.                                                    
                                                                                
To disconnect the link, we have to mainly destroy the main gateways. A single   
gateway connects with multiple links itself. Again, glitroids are spread and    
spawned around a gateway whenever any individual presence is detected.          
                                                                                
The tech and research team developed a patch to fight with the glitroids namely 
railgun protocol.                                                               
                                                                                
We need to report early in the morning tomorrow.
