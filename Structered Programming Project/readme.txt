### Gameplay casualities
---------------------------
>> Game difficulty of a particular minigame is locked once you choose it. So, if you find it too easy or hard, you need to start the chapter from beginning to change the difficulty.

>> You can pause each minigame pressing ESCAPE button while inside the minigame. From there, you can see the instructions in case you have forgotten. You can also choose to return to main menu that will make you lose all unsaved progress. Or, you can resume the minigame.

>> After failing in a particular minigame, you will get 10 to 0 countdown to restart the game. If you don't restart the minigame, you will be returned to main menu and lose all progress of the chapter.

>> Game is only saved after the end of a chapter. So, if there is a chapter with multiple games, you will lose the progress of previous games if you don't finish the last game and story of the chapter.
